# Remaining Components to Create

I'll create all the remaining frontend components now. Due to the number of files, I'm creating them systematically.

The components needed are:

## Admin Components:
1. ClientList.jsx
2. CreateClientModal.jsx (used by ClientList)
3. PromptEditor.jsx
4. ProductImport.jsx
5. ChatSimulator.jsx
6. AdminStats.jsx

## Client Components:
1. ClientDashboard.jsx
2. ChatInbox.jsx
3. ChatWindow.jsx (used by ChatInbox)
4. ProductCatalog.jsx
5. FAQEditor.jsx
6. Settings.jsx

Let me create them all now...
